This is keytool, a utility for manipulating public and private keys.

http://github.com/nevali/keytool

Current status:
	- Keys can currently be read in PEM or DER formats. For DER private
	  key input, you must explicitly specify the type of key using
	  '-t TYPE'. This is not required when reading public keys.

	- Public keys can be written as PEM, DER, SSH-2, OpenSSH, plain text,
	  and PGP format.

	- Private keys can be written as PEM, DER or plain text.

	- Encrypted keys can't be read or written at the moment.

	- The -C option can be used to specify a user ID when writing PGP keys.
	  Using this requires a private key, because a user ID must be
	  accompanied by a signature packet. Without -C, only a single PGP
	  public key packet will be written.

	- The -B (SSH bubblebabble digest) option is currently unimplemented.

	- The -f (PKCS/SHA-1 fingerprint) option is currently unimplemented.

	- DSA support is spotty (DSA keys cannot currently be generated).
