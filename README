This is keytool, a utility for manipulating public and private keys.

Current status:
	- Keys can currently be read only in PEM format.
	- Public keys can be written as PEM, SSH-2, OpenSSH, plain text, and
	  PGP format.
	- Private keys can be written as PEM or plain text.
	- The -C option can be used to specify a user ID when writing PGP keys.
      Using this requires a private key, because a user ID must be
	  accompanied by a signature packet. Without -C, only a single PGP
	  public key packet will be written.
	- The -B (SSH bubblebabble digest) option is currently unimplemented.
	- The -f (PKCS/SHA-1 fingerprint) option is currently unimplemented.
	- DSA support is spotty (DSA keys cannot currently be generated).
