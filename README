This is locksmith, a utility for manipulating public and private keys.

http://github.com/nevali/locksmith

Current status:
	! Encrypted keys can't be read or written at the moment. NO CARE IS
	! TAKEN to use a sensible RNG or secure memory when handling private
	! keys.

	- Keys can currently be read in PEM, DER or PEM-encoded PKCS#8
	  formats. For DER private key input, you must explicitly specify
	  the type of key using '-t TYPE'. This is not required when
	  reading public keys.

	- Public keys can be written in PEM, DER, SSH-2, OpenSSH, plain text,
	  PGP, RDF/XML and Turtle, DNSSEC DNSKEY, IPGP CERT, PKA, and SSHFP
	  formats.

	- Private keys can be written in PEM, DER, plain text, DNSSEC (BIND 9)
      and PEM-encoded PKCS#8 formats.

	- The -C option can be used to specify a user ID when writing PGP keys.
	  Using this requires a private key, because a user ID must be
	  accompanied by a signature packet. Without -C, only a single PGP
	  public key packet will be written.

	- DSA support is spotty (DSA keys cannot currently be generated).

Examples:

	Read an RSA private key in PEM format and emit a PGP public key with
	a signed user ID. The PGP key timestamp will match the private key
	file timestamp:

	    $ locksmith -i rsa-private.pem -o rsa-private.pgp -O pgp \
	        -C 'Joe Bloggs <joe.bloggs@example.com>'

	Read an RSA public key in PEM format and print just the SSH (MD5)
	fingerprint:

	    $ locksmith -i rsa-public.pem -O ssh2 -f -n
